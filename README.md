# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This program allows the user to add, delete, and load all for items that exist within a dynamoDB database. This uses
AWS as a serverless system and allows the user to do each of these functions with ease.

To use the site, simply clone the repo, open it in an ide of choice, and use a live preview extension on the index.html file.
